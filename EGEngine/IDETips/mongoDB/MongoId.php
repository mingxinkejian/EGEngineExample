/**
 * A unique identifier created for database objects.
 * If an object is inserted into the database without an _id field,
 * an _id field will be added to it with a MongoId instance as its value. If the data has a naturally occuring unique
 * field (say, a username or timestamp) it is fine to use this as the _id field instead, and it will not be
 * replaced with a MongoId.
 *
 * Instances of the MongoId class fulfill the role that autoincrementing does in a relational database: to provide a
 * unique key if the data does not natually have one. Autoincrementing does not work well with a sharded database, as
 * it is impossible to find what the next number should be quickly. This class fulfills the constraints of quickly
 * generating a value that is unique across shards.
 *
 * Each MongoId is 12 bytes (making its string form 24 hexidecimal characters). The first four bytes are a timestamp,
 * the next three are a hash of the client machine's hostname, the next two are the two least significant bytes of the
 * process id running the script, and the last three bytes are an incrementing value.
 *
 * MongoIds are serializable/unserializable.
